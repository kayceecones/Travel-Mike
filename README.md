For all my life I have loved to build, but had never been brave enough to learn how to do it on a computer. Magic Mike is my testament to leveraging psychological, emotional, and financial security to invest in something means the world to me but is not necessary for my survival. This project, although not finished, has taught me so much. In addition to being surprised with how easy it is to learn skills that had intimidated me for years, I also found that the magic of programming does not only lie in the technology itself, rather, in the ideas that we can bring into the world with its help.

To a burgeoning programmer and Magic Mike, the virtual fortune teller, welcome to the world.

About the Program: The quotes in this data base are hand selected from my own life, many from the people i love most. Every time I heard something that struck me as important, hilarious, or profound, I would write it down in the notes section of my phone. I had always wanted to create some sort of data base for them, but didn't have the tools to do it. When the time came, looked over at my trusty magic 8 ball and felt inspiration strike. Magic mike is the next iteration of a fortune telling Magic 8 ball. Instead of a pyramidal dice floating in a mystery liquid, he is an n-sided dice that is a data-repository, a bit of logic, and a UI for fortunes-on-the-go. More to come soon!
