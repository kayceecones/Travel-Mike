For all my life I have loved to build, but had never been brave enough to learn how to do it on a computer. Magic Mike is my testament to leveraging psychological, emotional, and financial security to invest in something 
means the world to me but is not necessary for my survival. 
This project, although not finished, has taught me so much. In addition to being surprised with how easy it is to learn skills that had intimidated me for years, I also found that the magic of programming does not only 
lie in the technology itself, rather, in the ideas that we can bring into the world with its help.  

To a burgeoning programmer and Magic Mike, the virtual fortune teller, welcome to the world. 

About the Program: 
The quotes in this data base are hand selected from my own life, many from the people i love most. 
Every time I heard something that struck me as important, hilarious, or profound, I would write it down in the notes section of my phone. I had always wanted to create some sort of data base for them, but 
didn't know how. When I finally believed that there was no way I _couldn't_ learn to code, I started thinking about what my first project should be. As I was skimming youtube and hating every project I saw,
I glanced over at my magic 8 ball. To add to my esoteric vibe, I often joke that it is how I make all my most important deicisons. When considering how well computers perform with picking random numbers associated with 
strings of text, I immediately knew what my first project was going to be... Magic Mike.
